## Project Introduction

In this analysis, I want to gauge social media user behavior and sentiment across various platforms to better understand social media users and how they interact on the platform. The Social Media Sentiments Analysis Dataset documents user interactions with one another through their posts, likes, and reshares across multiple social media platforms. This dataset is a snapshot of user-generated content consisting of text, sentiment, timestamps, usernames, platform used, hashtags, likes, reshares, and user country.

### Social Media Analysis Dataset

The Social Media Analysis Dataset captures a vibrant tapestry of emotions, trends, and interactions across various social media platforms. This dataset provides a snapshot of user-generated content, encompassing text, timestamps, hashtags, countries, likes, and retweets. Each entry unveils unique stories—moments of surprise, excitement, admiration, thrill, contentment, and more—shared by individuals worldwide.

## Objective

The objective is to provide insight into social media users and how they interact with online content and the platforms they use. The data used is the Social Media Sentiments Analysis Dataset that documents user interactions with one another through their posts, likes, and reshares across multiple social media platforms.

## Analysis Outline

This descriptive analysis aims to uncover new insights and unusual anomalies within the dataset by answering the following questions: 

- What are social media users’ preferred methods of engagement?

- What is the most common sentiment type in a post? Does post sentiment change on different platforms?

- Does user sentiment affect the length of their text posts?

- Does post seniment affect user engagement?

- Which hours of the dat are users most active?

- Which months are users most active?

- How has user engagement changed over time?

- Where are users geographically located?

## Conclusion

### Key Findings

•	Users prefer to engage with posts by using likes over reshares. On average, for every 1 reshare of a post users tend to receive 2 likes on all social media platforms.

•	Due to the scarcity of reshares on a post, it could indicate the intensity of the sentiment felt by the post content. The more reshares a post has the more engaging the post likely is. 

•	Contrary to popular belief, most social media posts are posts with positive sentiment (at least in this dataset). Positive sentiment posts outnumber negative posts by about 2-1 and neutral posts by 8-1 on all social media platforms.

•	The median length of a post is about the same on all social media platforms regardless of sentiment.

•	Positive and neutral posts on average perform about 20% better, on likes and reshares, than posts with negative sentiment.

•	Most interactive users on social media are most likely students who are still in school

•	Peak social media activity hours generally begin around 2 pm. After 2 pm user activity remains elevated until about 8 pm. At 8 pm social media activity starts to decline until midnight when most activity reaches its daily lows.

•	The general peak season for social media activity is during summer and winter break when students are not in school and have more time to engage in online content.

•	Social media engagement activities started to grow from 2014-2016, plateaued from 2016-2022, until growing again from 2022-2023.

•	Majority of the active social media users are mostly located in developed Western countries
